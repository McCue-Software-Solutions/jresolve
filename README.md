# jresolve

Dependency resolver for Java, currently in development.

The leading dependency resolvers for Java today are inflexible.
They are highly coupled with corresponding build systems in a way that reduces portability.

jresolve will be a dependency resolver, written in and for Java, with no external dependencies and compatible with any build system.
We will add more detail as we continue developing the project.
